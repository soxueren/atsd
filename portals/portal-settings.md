# Portal Settings

## Layout

Widget are positioned on the portal page using a **grid** layout. The dimensions of the grid are specified under the `[configuration]` tag.

```ls
[configuration]
  width-units = 3
  height-units = 2
```

In this example, the page is split into 3 columns and 2 rows.

The default portal grid dimensions are 6×4. 

The default widget size is 1×1 which can be adjusted with the `width-units` and `height-units` settings in the `[widget]` section to stretch the widget into multiple columns or rows.

To display multiple widgets on one row, group them using the `[group]` tag.

```ls
[configuration]
  width-units = 3
  height-units = 2
 
# 1st widget row
[group]
  [widget]
  [widget]
  [widget]
 
# 2nd widget row
[group]
  [widget]
  [widget]
  [widget]
```

As an alternative to creating groups for each row, add the `widgets-per-row` setting under the `[group]` tag.

```ls
[configuration]
  width-units = 3
  height-units = 2
 
[group]
  widgets-per-row = 3
  
  [widget]
  [widget]
  [widget]
  [widget]
  [widget]
  [widget]
```

### Connection Settings

| **Name** | **Example** | **Description** | **ChartLab** | 
| --- | --- | --- | --- | 
|  url  |  `url = http://atsd_hostname:port`  |  URL of the ATSD server. The setting is necessary if the data is loaded from an ATSD server running on a different host.  |  | 
|  context-path  |  `context-path = api/v2`  |  Context path. Default value is `api/v1`.  |  | 
| method-path | `method-path = /series/query` | Data API method path. Default value is specific for each data type: `/series/query`, `/properties/query`, `/messages/query`, `/alerts/query`. | |
|  url-parameters  |  `url-parameters = db=12&adapter=7`  |  Optional request parameters included in data API requests.<br>Parameter names and values must be URL-encoded if necessary and separated by ampersand. `?` at the start of the query string is optional. |  | 
|  update-interval  |  `update-interval = 5 minute`  |  Polling interval at which new incremental data is requested from the server by widgets on the portal.<br>For example `update-interval = 5 minute`.<br>The default value is 1 minute.<br>The setting can be overridden by each widget separately.<br>Chart updates are disabled if the endtime parameter for the portal or the widget is set to a fixed date, for example: `endtime = 2016-06-27T00:00:00Z`.  |  [View](https://apps.axibase.com/chartlab/808e5846/3/)  | 
|  batch-update  |  `batch-update = true`  |  Sending data queries to the server in batches with size specified in `batch-size` setting. Default: false.<br>If enabled, series for which the request has failed will be requested separately from successfully updated series.  |  [View](https://apps.axibase.com/chartlab/808e5846/4/)  | 
|  batch-size  |  `batch-size = 1`  |  Maximum number of series in one batch request to the server. Default: 8.<br>If 0 is specified, the limit is not set.<br>Applies when `batch-update = true`.  |  [View](https://apps.axibase.com/chartlab/808e5846/5/)  | 

> The actual URL for data requests is assembled from `{url}{context-path}{method-path}{url-parameters}`. For example, the default URL for loading series data is `https://atsd_host:8443/api/v1/series/query`.

## Comments

Comments provide a way to annotate and describe the settings. Comment text is ignored when the configuration is parsed and evaluated.

### Single-line Comments

A single line comment starts with `#`. Text after the `#` is ignored.

```ls
[widget]
  type = chart   
  # Metric field will be inherited by all series in the widget
  metric = nmon.cpu_total.busy%
```

A hash symbol in the middle of a line (preceded by any character other than tab or whitespace) is escaped and treated as regular text.

```ls
[widget]
  type = chart   
  # Next line does not contain any comments because hash is preceded by characters other than tab or whitespace.
  title = Hello # World
```

### Multi-line Comments

Multi-line comments start with /* and end with */.

Any text between /* and */ will be ignored.

```ls
[widget]
  type = chart
  /*   
     This widget provides information on CPU
     utilization measured in percent of available capacity.
  */  
  metric = nmon.cpu_total.busy%
```

#### Placeholders

You can insert placeholders into the configuration text to populate it with values of the request parameters. Placeholders have the `{placeholderName}` format. The value of the placeholder is parsed from the query string from any parameter starting with `p_`, i.e. `p_placeholderName`.

```ls
[series]
  entity = {id}
  metric = cpu_busy
```

Invoked with `?p_id=nurswgvml002`, the above configuration is converted into the following text:

```ls
[series]
  entity = nurswgvml002
  metric = cpu_busy
```
