# Parser

The nmon parser ingests raw nmon files and converts them to properties and metrics in ATSD.

During the installation of ATSD, a default nmon parser is created for ingesting standard nmon files. Settings of the default parser are shown in the table below.

#### Parser Settings

| Setting | Description | Default Parser Settings | 
| --- | --- | --- | 
|  Name  |  Name of the current parser.  |  default  | 
|  Metric Prefix  |  Prefix to be added before each nmon metric in order to distinguish and sort metrics with same or similar names. For example: using the prefix nmon will convert the metric `cpu_total.busy` to `nmon.cpu_total.busy`.  |  nmon  | 
|  Ignored  |  nmon metrics to be ignored. Metrics listed here will not be imported. Acts as a filter.  |  none  | 
|  Process TOP  |  Ingest TOP data.  |  Yes  | 
|  Process UARG  |  Ingest user and arg columns.  |  Yes  | 
|  Enable Properties  |  Store entity properties and configurations in ATSD from the nmon file.  |  Yes  | 
|  Ignore Errors  |  Ignore all errors. Parses only known metrics and properties.  |  No  | 
|  Retention Interval  |  How long the uploaded nmon file will be stored on the ATSD server. 2 days by default.  |  2 days  |
