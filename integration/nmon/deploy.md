# Deploy nmon

In order to install nmon and the Axibase sender script on multiple Linux machines use the `nmon_deploy.sh` script.

The `nmon_deploy.sh` script will execute the following steps on each specified target machine:


- Connect to the remote machine over ssh
- Copy the nmon binary file
- Copy the atsd sender script
- Add a cron task to restart the nmon data collection on a schedule


Get the latest nmon files, [nmon_deploy.sh](resources/nmon_deploy.sh), and sender script from our GitHub page: [https://github.com/axibase/nmon](https://github.com/axibase/nmon)

`nmon_deploy.sh` accepts the following flags:

| Flag | Description | 
| --- | --- | 
|  -c  |  Set path to the `deploy.properties` file, that contains all the configurations required by the `nmon_deploy.sh` script.  | 
|  -n  |  Does not modify cron. Only updates nmon binary file and ATSD sender script.<br>Useful to update nmon or sender script to a new version.  | 
|  -d  |  Comments out all nmon cron tasks. Will stop nmon data collection and delivery to ATSD  | 
|  -i  |  While nmon does not have any dependencies, the ATSD sender script has the following dependencies: crontab, telnet.<br>With -i flag the script will only check and install dependencies.<br>Requires sudo credentials defined in the `deploy.properties` file.<br>After installing the dependencies, run the script again without the -i flag to install the nmon and sender script.  | 


The `deploy.properties` file contains the target machine parameters, user details, and paths to nmon and crontab settings:

Use hashtags `#` to comment out optional parameters.

The following files must be located in the same directory as the `nmon_deploy.sh` script (path to files is set in the `deploy.properties` file):


- nmon binary file
- Sender script
- Target machine user ssh key
- atsdreadonly ssh key


| Setting | Description | 
| --- | --- | 
|  nmon.s  |  Pause between nmon snapshots.  | 
|  nmon.c  |  nmon snapshot count.  | 
|  nmon.cron.hour  |  cron task start hour.  | 
|  nmon.cron.minute  |  cron task start minute.  | 
|  atsd.protocol  |  Data transfer protocol that will be used.<br>Possible values: telnet, ssh.  | 
|  atsd.port  |  ATSD port that will receive the nmon data.  | 
|  atsd.key  |  Path to ssh key for readonly account.<br>`id_rsa_atsdreadonly` by default.<br>Optional parameter.  | 
|  atsd.user  |  Readonly user account.<br>`atsdreadonly` by default.<br>Optional parameter.  | 
|  atsd.hostname  |  ATSD server that will store the nmon data.  | 
|  deploy.user  |  User of target machines.  | 
|  deploy.key  |  Path to the ssh key to access target machines by the user set in `deploy.user`.  | 
|  deploy.password  |  Password of target machine user set in the `deploy.user` setting.<br>Password takes priority over ssh key.  | 
|  deploy.sudo.user  |  Sudo user of target machines.<br>Optional parameter.  | 
|  deploy.sudo.key  |  Path to sudo users ssh key to access target machines.<br>Optional parameter.  | 
|  deploy.sudo.password  |  Password of target machine sudo user set in the `deploy.sudo.user` setting.<br>Password takes priority over ssh key.<br>Optional Parameter.  | 
|  deploy.nmon-binary  |  Path to nmon binary file that will be installed on target machines.  | 
|  deploy.directory  |  Directory that will be used on target machines to install nmon and the sender script.<br>The user must have write access to this directory.  | 
|  deploy.target  |  Target server hostname or ip address and ssh connection port separated by `:`<br>Can be set to multiple servers, one server per line.  | 


Example `deploy.properties` file:

```
nmon.s = 60
nmon.c = 1440
nmon.cron.hour = 12
nmon.cron.minute = 19
 
atsd.protocol = telnet
atsd.port = 8081
#atsd.key=./id_rsa_atsdreadonly
#atsd.user=atsdreadonly
atsd.hostname = atsdserver.com
 
deploy.user = nmonuser
deploy.key = ./id_dsa_nmonuser
deploy.password=secret-pwd
#deploy.sudo.user = root
#deploy.sudo.key = ./id_dsa_root
#deploy.sudo.password=secret-root-pwd
deploy.nmon-binary = nmon_x86_64_sles11
deploy.directory = /home/nmonuser/nmon
deploy.target = nurswgvml006:22
deploy.target = nurswgvml007:22
deploy.target = nurswgvml008:22
deploy.target = nurswgvml009:22
```

Once the `deploy.properties` file is set up and paths to the required files are set, deploy nmon and the sender script to remote target machines:

```
./nmon_deploy.sh
```

The script will check each machine for dependencies and show installation progress/results on screen.
