#### Interpolation Functions:

Interpolation functions can insert missing intervals in returned aggregated data:

| Function Name | Description | 
| --- | --- | 
|  STEP  |  Missing value equals previous (last) value.  | 
|  LINEAR  |  Missing value is computed using linear interpolation between previous (last) and next available value.  | 
|  NONE  |  Missing values are not inserted.  | 


If the interpolation function is not specified in the request, missing intervals are not created.
