| 3831 | api-rest    | Bug     | Fixed metric [`series`](../../api/meta/entity/get.md#entity-get) request processing if series count exceeds 1000. Added a warning message to web UI when the threshold is reached. |

## ATSD

### Issue 3742
--------------

A `Text Column` button was added to the user interface export form. By enabling this button, a text column will be displayed for data exported in CSV and HTML formats.   

Now, a [text value](../../api/network/series.md#series-tags-text-value-messages) can be used to annotate a numeric observation without changing the series primary key. See
[Issue 3480](../../changelogs/2017_02#issue-3480) for more information.

## Collector

### Issue 3818
--------------

The [Test] result now includes a list of columns from the underlying dataset and information on how they're mapped into command fields. The table contains column attributes as well as the following fields:

* Schema Type: classifies how the column is processed in ATSD commands, e.g. metric, series tag, time, property type, etc.
* Included: determines if the column is included in ATSD commands or is excluded (ignored).

### Issue 3772
--------------

In order to simplify processing of JSON documents created with [Open Data](https://project-open-data.cio.gov/v1.1/schema/) schema, we implemented a new [Socrata](https://github.com/axibase/axibase-collector/blob/master/docs/jobs/socrata.md) job. Support for Socrata format has been removed from the JSON job as a result.

The configuration options implemented in the Socrata job provide a way to convert the dataset into series, property, and message fields in ATSD.
