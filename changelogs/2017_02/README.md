|---------------|-----------------|---------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [3773](#issue-3773) | sql             | Bug     | Implemented rules for numeric precedence in [`atsd_series`](/api/sql/examples/select-atsd_series.md) queries. If the query requests several metrics with different datatypes, no precision loss will occur. |
| 3770 | api-rest        | Bug     | Removed versioning tags from [`exactMatch`](/api/data/series/query.md#series-filter-fields) checks to prevent empty result sets. |
| [3769](#issue-3769) | sql             | Bug     | Updated the [`LOOKUP`](/api/sql#lookup) function to accept series, entity, and metric tags as parameters. |
| [3768](#issue-3768) | sql             | Feature | Extended the [`CONCAT`](/api/sql#string-functions) function to accept numeric arguments without [`CAST`](/api/sql#cast)-ing. |
| [3767](#issue-3767) | sql             | Feature | Updated the [`CAST`](/api/sql#cast) function to convert numeric arguments to strings. |
| [3764](#issue-3764) | sql             | Bug     | Fixed NullPointException error when data was queried for a newly created metric without any data. |
| [3763](#issue-3763) | sql             | Bug     | Updated the [`SELECT 1`](/api/sql#validation-query) validation query implementation to return exactly one row containing columns included in the `SELECT` expression. |
| [3480](#issue-3480) | api-rest        | Feature | Added support for the [`text`](/api/data/series/query.md#value-object) field in the [series query](/api/data/series/query.md) method. |

| [3755](#issue-3755) | docker          | Feature | Added new [size metrics](https://github.com/axibase/axibase-collector-docs/blob/master/jobs/docker/volume-size.md) for Docker containers: `docker.fs.size.rw` and `docker.fs.size.rootfs`. | 
| 3752 | docker          | Bug     | Fixed issues with mis-matching volume labels by removing old records from the embedded database. | 
| 3734 | docker          | Bug     | Fixed issue with stopped container status not being instantly sent into ATSD. | 
| 3733 | docker          | Bug     | Eliminated database table locks, which resulted in the collection of all statistics being stopped. |

| [3481](#issue-3481) | widget-settings | Feature | Implemented a JavaScript replacement for the freemarker `getSeries` method. | 
| [3078](#issue-3078) | widget-settings | Feature | Added support for new series settings [`exact-match`](https://axibase.com/products/axibase-time-series-database/visualization/widgets/configuring-the-widgets/) and [`interpolate-extend`](https://axibase.com/products/axibase-time-series-database/visualization/widgets/configuring-the-widgets/). |
| [2928](#issue-2928) | widget-settings | Feature | Changed setting name from `interpolate` to [`fill-value`](https://axibase.com/products/axibase-time-series-database/visualization/widgets/time-chart/) to prevent collision.|


### Issue 3769
--------------

Fixed the [`LOOKUP`](/api/sql#lookup) function so that now it can accept series, metric, and entity tags as parameters.

```sql
SELECT datetime, value, metric, metric.tags.digital_set 
  ,LOOKUP('BatchAct', value) AS VAL
  ,LOOKUP(metric.tags.digital_set, value) AS VALTAG
FROM 'ba:active.1' 
  LIMIT 10
```

```ls
| datetime                 | value  | metric      | metric.tags.digital_set | VAL      | VALTAG   | 
|--------------------------|--------|-------------|-------------------------|----------|----------| 
| 2016-11-02T18:00:06.000Z | -65536 | ba:active.1 | BatchAct                | Inactive | Inactive | 
| 2016-11-02T18:10:06.000Z | -65537 | ba:active.1 | BatchAct                | Active   | Active   | 
```

### Issue 3768
--------------

Revised the [`CONCAT`](/api/sql#string-functions) function to accept numeric arguments without [`CAST`](/api/sql#cast)-ing. Multiple strings are able to be joined into a single string. This function accepts numeric values, 
which are converted to strings using a `#.##` pattern. 

```sql
SELECT datetime, value, metric, metric.tags.digital_set
,LOOKUP('pi-all', concat('BatchAct:', value))
FROM 'ba:active.1' 
  LIMIT 10
```

### Issue 3767
--------------

The [`CAST`](/api/sql#cast) function transforms a string into a number, or a number into a string. `CAST`-ing numbers to strings is required so that you can pass numeric values as arguments into string 
functions for series that collect discrete codes. Applying `CAST` to string returns a string for a numeric value formatted with a `#.##` pattern.

```sql
SELECT datetime, value, metric, metric.tags.digital_set
  ,LOOKUP('pi-all', concat('BatchAct:', CAST(value as string)))
FROM 'ba:active.1' 
  LIMIT 10
```

### Issue 3763
--------------

Previously, the [`SELECT 1`](/api/sql#validation-query) query didn't return any rows. 

| 1 |

The `SELECT 1` query has been updated to return the header and one row and all the corresponding columns included in the `SELECT` expression.

### Issue 3480
--------------

Support was added for the text field (named `x`) in HTTP API for series [queries](/api/data/series/query.md#value-object) and [insert](/api/data/series/insert.md#value-object) requests. Previously, `t`, `d`, `v`, and `s` were the allowable inputs. Now ATSD is capable of 
processing and saving `x` as text for a series sample. The empty string `""` is also supported and will be stored as `""`. 

```json
{"d":"2016-06-01T12:08:42Z", "x": "Shutdown"}
``` 
 
### Issue 3481
--------------

`getTags()` and `getSeries()` functions now make simultaneous request to `/api/v1/metrics/{metric}/series`, which is described in further detail in
 https://github.com/axibase/atsd-docs/blob/master/api/meta/metric/series.md
 
`getSeries()` returns a list of series from a given response (in JSON). `getTags()` processes a list of series from a given response and returns a list of unique values for the 
specified `tag`.

```ls
getTags( metric, tagName [, entity, [ , minInsertDate [ , maxInsertDate [ , url ] ] ] ] )
```

```ls
getSeries( metric, [, entity, [ , minInsertDate [ , maxInsertDate [ , url ] ] ] ] )
```

### Issue 3078
--------------

Added new query settings [`exact-match`](https://axibase.com/products/axibase-time-series-database/visualization/widgets/configuring-the-widgets/) and [`interpolate-extend`](https://axibase.com/products/axibase-time-series-database/visualization/widgets/configuring-the-widgets/). `exact-match` selects series with exactly the same `tags` as requested, with the default set to `false`. `interpolate-extend` 
adds missing periods at the beginning and the end of a selection interval, with the default also being `false`.

### Issue 2928
--------------

To prevent collision, the `interpolate` setting was renamed to [`fill-value`](https://axibase.com/products/axibase-time-series-database/visualization/widgets/time-chart/), which is an interpolation mode applied to computed series in case the values are irregularly spaced. 
If set to true, the missing samples are filled with interpolated values. When `fill-value` is set to the `interpolate` keyword, the missing value is linearly interpolated from the 
previous and preceding values.

### Issue 3755
--------------

The following aggregate [metrics](https://github.com/axibase/axibase-collector-docs/blob/master/jobs/docker/volume-size.md) for Docker container sizes were added:

* `docker.fs.total.size.rw`: the total size of all the files for all containers, in bytes. 
* `docker.fs.total.size.rootfs` - the size of the files which have been created or changed for all containers. 
* `docker.fs.running.size.rw` - the total size of all the files for all running containers, in bytes. 
* `docker.fs.running.size.rootfs` - the size of the files which have been created or changed for running containers. 

The following metrics are collected at the docker-host level.

https://apps.axibase.com/chartlab/81932cd6

The metrics are collected at 'Container Size Interval' for running containers and at 'Property Refresh Interval' for all containers.

### Issue 3773
--------------

```sql
SELECT datetime, entity, metric, value
 FROM atsd_series
WHERE metric IN ('tst-metric-short',
                'tst-metric-integer',
                'tst-metric-long',
                'tst-metric-float',
                'tst-metric-double',
                'tst-metric-decimal')
```                

### Issue 3764
--------------

```sql
SELECT * FROM test_new_metric_without_data
```
