# Monitoring Metrics using I/O Tests

I/O Tests can be run directly from the ATSD user interface under **Admin > Diagnostics > I/O Tests**.

Direct url: `atsd_hostname:8088/admin/io-tests`

I/O Tests allow you to:

-   Execute disk read and write tests for the server on which the ATSD
    instance is running.
-   Identify any abnormalities, such as slower than expected write speed.
