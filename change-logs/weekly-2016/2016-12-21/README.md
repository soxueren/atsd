### Issue 3685
--------------

Recently added to the [`docker`](https://github.com/axibase/axibase-collector-docs/blob/master/jobs/docker.md#docker-job) job in Collector is the ability to remove deleted records in ATSD for objects that no longer exist in Docker itself.

![Figure 1](Figure1.png)

This capability is useful to purge ATSD of containers that no longer exist in Docker, for instance containers that existed only for a few minutes during image build stage, or containers
that executed short-term tasks and were removed with the `docker rm` command. Containers with a `deleted` status will initially be retained in ATSD for the specified time interval (for
example 50 days in the above image). The status of these containers is marked as `deleted`, as shown in the image below.

![Figure 2](Figure2.png)

By default such records with the status `deleted` are not actually removed from ATSD, potentially leaving unnecessary records in ATSD. To delete containers after a certain number of days, enter in a positive integer.

* `Retain deleted container records, days` : containers with a `deleted` status will initially be retained in ATSD for the specified time interval. The status of these containers is marked as `deleted`. After the interval has passed, the containers will be permanently removed from ATSD.

To remove deleted image/volume/network records, enable the `Retain deleted image/volume/network records` checkbox.

* `Remove deleted image/volume/network records` : removes images/volumes/networks with a `deleted` status from ATSD.

The deletion occurs at the same time as the property check interval. All deletions are logged to collector file.

### Issue 3701
--------------

In this issue, we took a look at optimizing [partitioning queries](https://github.com/axibase/atsd-docs/tree/master/api/sql#partitioning), leveraging the fact that we can narrow the start and end date for a scan based on the last times in the Last
Insert Table. Let's take the below query as an example.

```sql
SELECT tags.city, tags.state, value
  FROM cdc.all_deaths
WHERE entity = 'mr8w-325u' AND tags.city IS NOT NULL
  AND tags.region = '2'
WITH ROW_NUMBER(tags ORDER BY datetime desc) <= 1
  ORDER BY value DESC
```

Since the timespan is not defined in the `WHERE` clause, previously we would not apply any date filter to scanned records.
To optimize the query we now perform a lookup of the minimum insert time for the specified metric, entity, and series tags.
Since the minimum insert time in the above example is `1972-05-27T00:00:00Z`, we can now use it to apply time filter within the scan. A condition like `ROW_NUMBER(tags ORDER BY datetime desc) <= 1` means we
only need the last value for each combination of tags. We can therefore skip values with a timestamp less than the minimum last insert time.

Check out our article on [SQL queries for U.S. death statistics](https://github.com/axibase/atsd-use-cases/blob/master/USMortality/README.md).

### Issue 3717
--------------

While Axibase Collector gathers container properties and statistics using full Docker identifiers, it sends container names as entity labels into ATSD. This makes it possible to refer
to human-readable container names in graphs and alerts. There are however several orchestration frameworks which use container names to store their own identifiers, for
instance [Mesos](http://mesos.apache.org/):

* Mesos Container ID:

```json
"Id": "02cb3257b06ef11adc1b2633db55c94e2646f84e7b84cc665c28d710dc2f986c"
```

* Mesos Container Name:

```json
"Name": "/mesos-cd2d0996-558b-4a49-88a0-79c41aeb098a-S2.0a36b7d9-5dfc-4963-b8ac-0e7656103782"
```

In this case neither container identifier nor container name are user-friendly or human-readable. To handle these kinds of scenarios, we added a small bit of heuristics to inherit the container
label from the `CONTAINER_NAME` environment variable which is set by Mesos.

As a result, the below container will have a label `ref-api-front` instead of `mesos-cd2d0996-558b-4a49-88a0-79c41aeb098a-S2.0a36b7d9-5dfc-4963-b8ac-0e7656103782`.
