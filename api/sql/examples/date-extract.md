# Date Extract Functions

## EXTRACT


```sql
SELECT datetime,
  EXTRACT(year FROM datetime) AS "year",
  EXTRACT(quarter FROM datetime) AS "quarter",
  EXTRACT(month FROM datetime) AS "month",
  EXTRACT(day FROM datetime) AS "day",
  EXTRACT(hour FROM datetime) AS "hour",
  EXTRACT(minute FROM datetime) AS "minute",
  EXTRACT(second FROM datetime) AS "second",
  EXTRACT(day FROM now - 1*DAY) AS "prev_day",
  EXTRACT(month FROM now + 1*MONTH) AS "next_month"
FROM "mpstat.cpu_busy"
  WHERE datetime > current_hour
```

```ls
| datetime             | year | quarter | month | day | hour | minute | second | prev_day | next_month |
|----------------------|------|---------|-------|-----|------|--------|--------|----------|------------|
| 2017-07-29T21:00:12Z | 2017 | 3       | 7     | 29  | 9    | 0      | 12     | 28       | 8          |
```

## EXTRACT in grouping

```sql
SELECT EXTRACT(day FROM datetime) AS "day",
  AVG(value)
FROM "mpstat.cpu_busy"
  WHERE datetime > current_month
GROUP BY 'day'
  ORDER BY AVG(value) DESC
```

```ls
| day | avg(value) |
|-----|------------|
| 21  | 11.1       |
| 24  | 9.6        |
| 25  | 9.3        |
```

## EXTRACT alternatives

The `extract` function is analogous to YEAR(), QUARTER(), MONTH(), etc. functions listed below.

```sql
SELECT datetime,
  YEAR(datetime) AS "year",
  QUARTER(datetime) AS "quarter",
  MONTH(datetime) AS "month",
  DAY(datetime) AS "day",
  HOUR(datetime) AS "hour",
  MINUTE(datetime) AS "minute",
  SECOND(datetime) AS "second",
  date_format(time, 'yyyy-MMM-dd, EEE') AS "date",
  DAYOFWEEK(datetime) AS "dow"
FROM "mpstat.cpu_busy"
  WHERE datetime > current_hour
```

## EXTRACT with BETWEEN and IN (range)

```ls
| datetime             | year | quarter | month | day | hour | minute | second | date             | dow |
|----------------------|------|---------|-------|-----|------|--------|--------|------------------|-----|
| 2017-07-29T21:00:12Z | 2017 | 3       | 7     | 29  | 9    | 0      | 12     | 2017-Jul-29, Sat | 7   |
```

```sql
SELECT HOUR(datetime) AS "hour",
  AVG(value)
FROM "mpstat.cpu_busy"
  WHERE datetime > previous_day
  AND HOUR(datetime) BETWEEN 5 and 9
GROUP BY "hour"
```

```ls
| hour | avg(value) |
|------|------------|
| 5    | 6.0        |
| 6    | 6.4        |
| 7    | 5.6        |
| 8    | 6.2        |
| 9    | 6.3        |
```
