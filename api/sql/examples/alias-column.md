# Column Alias

Column aliases can be unquoted or enclosed in quotes or double-quotes.

An unquoted `alias` should start with a letter [a-zA-Z], followed by a letter, digit, or underscore.

## Query

SELECT datetime, value, entity "server", metric AS "measurement" 
  FROM "mpstat.cpu_busy" 
WHERE entity = 'nurswgvml006'
