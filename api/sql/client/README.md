# Overview

SQL client provides a convenient way to query the Axibase Time Series Database using SQL and export results to a file or standard output in a variety of formats.

The client is a bash script that parses and validates input parameters and executes an http/s request to `/api/sql` API endpoint in the database using credentials stored in the `atsd.config` file. 

## Security

Make sure that `sql.sh` has execution permissions.

```
chmod +x sql.sh
```

Username and password of the user executing the query must be specified in the `atsd.config` file located in the same directory as the `sql.sh` file.

The user should have an `API_DATA_READ` role and relevant entity read permissions.

The client is stateless with each query triggering a separate http request with the `Basic` authentication.

If the database url specified in the `atsd.config` file is secure, both the query as well as results are encrypted.

## `atsd.config` File

```ls
url=https://10.102.0.6:8443/api/sql
insecure=true
user=axibase
password=********
```

## Parameters

```ls
./sql.sh --output /tmp/report-2.csv --query "SELECT entity, value FROM \"mpstat.cpu_busy\" WHERE datetime > now - 1*minute LIMIT 3"
```

Execute query specified in the `query.sql` file and write CSV results to `/tmp/report-1.csv`.

```ls
./sql.sh -o /tmp/report-1.csv -i query.sql -f csv
```

Execute inline query and redirect output to a file.

```
./sql.sh -q "SELECT * FROM \"mpstat.cpu_busy\" WHERE datetime > now-1*hour LIMIT 2" > /tmp/test.csv
```

Execute inline query with escaped double quotes.

```
./sql.sh -q "SELECT * FROM \"mpstat.cpu_busy\" WHERE datetime > now-1*hour LIMIT 5"
```
