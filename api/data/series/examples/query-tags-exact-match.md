# Series Query: Exact Match

## Description

`exactMatch` can exclude series with tags not specified in the request.

## Match Example

Assuming series A,B,C, and D have the following series tags:

```ls
| series | metric | entity | tag-1 | tag-2 |
|--------|--------|--------|-------|-------|
| A      | m-1    | e-1    | val-1 | val-2 |
| B      | m-1    | e-1    | val-1 |       |
| C      | m-1    | e-1    |       | val-2 |
| D      | m-1    | e-1    |       |       |
```

Queries would return the following series:

```ls
| exactMatch | requested tags | match   | 
|------------|----------------|---------| 
| true       |                | D       | - no tags specified in the request, series with additional tags are ignored because exactMatch=true
| false      |                | A;B;C;D | - no tags specified in the request, series with additional tags returned because exactMatch=false
| true       | tag-1=val-1    | B       | - A and B match the requested series tag-1, but A is ignored because exactMatch=true and A has an additional series tag-2
| false      | tag-1=val-1    | A;B     | - A and B match the requested series tag-1, and A is included because exactMatch=false and A's additional series tag-2 is allowed 
| true       | tag-2=*        | C       | - A and C match the requested series tag-2, but A is ignored because exactMatch=true and A has an additional series tag-1
| false      | tag-2=*        | A;C     | - A and C match the requested series tag-2, and A is included because exactMatch=false and A's additional series tag-1 is allowed 
```
