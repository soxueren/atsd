# Series Query: Period Endtime

## Description

By default, period start time is based on calendar. 

For 1-minute period, each period starts at 0 seconds of each minute, for 1-hour period the period starts at 0 minute and 0 seconds of each hour, etc.

This is called `CALENDAR` alignment. 

The default alignment can be changed so that the period's start or end time is aligned with boundaries of the requested time range, for example.
