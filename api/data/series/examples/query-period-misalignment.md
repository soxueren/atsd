# Series Query: Period Misalignment

## Description

If the time range between `startDate` and `endDate` cannot be filled with a whole number of periods, some of the periods will contain a subset of data and some of the periods will be excluded from the result set because their start time will be before the `startDate`.

The below query produced no data because:

1. With the default `CALENDAR` alignment, the 1-minute periods overlapping the time range are: `[14:20:00-14:21:00)` and `[14:21:00-14:22:00)`
2. The `[14:20:00-14:21:00)` period has 4 samples as provided below, but its start time is before the `startDate`.
3. The `[14:21:00-14:22:00)` period's start time is within the time range (period's start time is before `endDate`); however, the detailed data for this period was limited with an `endDate` of `14:22:01` and therefore period doesn't have any samples.
