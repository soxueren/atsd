# CSV File Upload

## Description

Upload a CSV file or multiple CSV files for parsing into series, properties, or messages with the specified CSV parser.

File(s) can be optionally compressed with gzip or zip. 

Multiple files can be archived with zip/tar and uploaded as one zip or tar.gz archive.

This method supports processing of the uploaded attached file as data as well as a part in a multi-part payload.

## Date Limits

* Minimum time that can be stored in the database is **1970-01-01T00:00:00.000Z**, or 0 milliseconds from Epoch time.
* Maximum date that can be stored by the database is **2106-02-07T06:59:59.999Z**, or 4294969199999 milliseconds from Epoch time.
* If the date is outside of the above range, file processing will terminate at the line containing invalid date and a corresponding error will be raised for the client.
