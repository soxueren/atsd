# `series` Command

## Description

Use the `series` command to insert a timestamped value (number or text) into a specified time series, uniquely identified by a composite primary key consisting of an entity, metric, and optional `key=value` tag(s).

## Syntax

```css
series d:{iso-date} e:{entity} t:{tag-1}={val-1} m:{metric-1}={number}
```

The command may include multiple values for different metrics, which inherit the same entity, time, and tags.

```css
series d:{iso-date} e:{entity} t:{tag-1}={val-1} m:{metric-1}={number} m:{metric-2}={number} x:{metric-3}={text}
```

### Fields

| **Field** | **Type** | **Description** |
|:---|:---|:---|
| e         | string          | **[Required]** Entity name. |
| m         | string:number   | **[Required]** Metric name and numeric value. _Multiple._ |
| x         | string:string   | **[Required]** Metric name and text value. _Multiple._ |
| d         | string          | Time in ISO format. |
| ms        | integer         | Time in UNIX milliseconds. |
| s         | integer         | Time in UNIX seconds. |
| t         | string:string   | Tag name and text value. _Multiple._ |
| a         | boolean         | Text append flag. If set to `true`, it causes the text value to be appended to the previous text value with the same timestamp. |

> At least one numeric metric `m:` or text metric `x:` is required.

> If the numeric observation was not specified for the text value with the same metric name, it is set to `NaN` (not a number).

> If the time fields `d, s, and ms` are omitted, the values are inserted with the current server time.

### ABNF Syntax

Rules are inherited from [Base ABNF](base-abnf.md).

```properties
  ; entity and at least one metric is required
command = "series" MSP entity 1*(MSP [metric-numeric / metric-text]) *(MSP tag) [MSP append] [MSP time]
entity = "e:" NAME
metric-numeric = "m:" NAME "=" NUMBER
metric-text    = "x:" NAME "=" VALUE
tag = "t:" NAME "=" VALUE
append = "a:" ("true" / "false")
time = time-millisecond / time-second / time-iso
time-millisecond = "ms:" POSITIVE_INTEGER
time-second = "s:" POSITIVE_INTEGER
time-iso = "d:" ISO_DATE
```

## Limits

Refer to [limits](README.md#command-limits).

## Data Types

New metrics will be initialized with the `float` data type by default.

To insert metric samples with another data type, create or update metric properties using [Meta API](../meta/metric/update.md) or the user interface.

## New Records

If the command references non-existent entities, metrics, or tags, they will be created as new records and registered automatically.

## Case Sensitivity

* Entity name, metric names, and tag names are case-insensitive and are converted to lower case when stored.
* Tag values are case-sensitive and are stored as submitted.

```ls
# input command
series e:nurSWG m:Temperature=38.5 t:Degrees=Celsius
# stored record
series e:nurswg m:temperature=38.5 t:degrees=Celsius
```

## Examples

* Insert the numeric value '72' for the metric 'cpu_used' from the entity 'server001' recorded on March 4, 2015 at 15:14:40 GMT (Unix epoch seconds = 1425482080).

```ls
series e:server001 m:cpu_used=72.0 s:1425482080
```

* Insert samples for two series:
  - Insert the numeric value '72' for the metric 'cpu_used' from the entity 'server001' recorded on March 4, 2015 at 15:14:40 GMT
  - Insert the numeric value '94.5' for the metric 'memory_used' and the same entity and time.

```ls
series e:server001 m:cpu_used=72.0 m:memory_used=94.5 s:1425482080
```

* Same as the above, using Unix milliseconds.

```ls
series e:server001 m:cpu_used=72.0 m:memory_used=94.5 ms:1425482080000
```

* Same as the above, using ISO8601 date.

```ls
series e:server001 m:cpu_used=72.0 m:memory_used=94.5 d:2015-03-04T15:14:40Z
```

* Insert the numeric value '20.5' for the metric 'disk_used_percent' from the entity 'server001' and the two tags 'mount_point' and 'disk_name'. The value will be inserted with the current server time since the date is not specified in the command.

```ls
series e:server001 m:disk_used_percent=20.5 t:mount_point=/ t:disk_name=/sda1
```

* Insert numeric values into two series (metrics 'disk_used_percent' and 'disk_size_md') for the same entity and tags as above.

```ls
series e:server001 m:disk_used_percent=20.5 m:disk_size_mb=10240 t:mount_point=/ t:disk_name=/sda1
```

* Insert the numeric value '24.4' and the text value 'Provisional' (annotation) for the metric 'temperature' from the entity 'sensor-1'.

```ls
series d:2016-10-13T08:15:00Z e:sensor-1 m:temperature=24.4 x:temperature="Provisional"
```

* Insert the text value 'Shutdown by adm-user, RFC-5434' for the metric 'status', from the entity 'sensor-1'.

```ls
series d:2016-10-13T10:30:00Z e:sensor-1 x:status="Shutdown by adm-user, RFC-5434"
```

* Same as the above. Append the specified text value to an existing value, if found.

```ls
series d:2016-10-13T10:30:00Z e:sensor-1 x:status="Shutdown by adm-user, RFC-5434" a:true
```

* Insert 'NaN' (Not-a-Number) for the metric 'temperature' from the entity 'sensor-1'

```ls
series d:2016-10-13T08:45:00Z e:sensor-1 m:temperature=NaN
```

## Number Representation

* A numeric value can be a real number or `NaN` (Not a Number).
* The string representation of a real number can consist of optional signs, '+' ('\u002B') or '-' ('\u002D'), followed by a sequence of zero or more decimal digits ("the integer"), optionally followed by a fraction, optionally followed by an exponent.
* The exponent consists of the character 'e' ('\u0065') or 'E' ('\u0045') followed by an optional sign, '+' ('\u002B') or '-' ('\u002D'), followed by one or more decimal digits. The value of the exponent must lie between -2147483647 and 2147483647, and is inclusive.
* The fraction consists of a decimal point followed by zero or more decimal digits. The string must contain at least one digit in either the integer or the fraction.
* The number formed by the sign, the integer, and the fraction is referred to as the [**significand**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Significand).
* The **significand** value, stripped of trailing zeros, should be within the Long.MAX_VALUE `9223372036854775807` and the Long.MIN_VALUE  `-9223372036854775808` (19 digits). Otherwise the database will throw an **llegalArgumentException: BigDecimal significand overflows the long type** for decimal metrics or round the value for non-decimal metrics. For example, significand for `1.1212121212121212121212121212121212121212121` contains 44 digits and will be rounded to `1.121212121212121212` if inserted for a non-decimal metric.

## Series Tags, Text Value, Messages

Text inserted with the `x:` field annotates the accompanying numeric value and is not part of the series composite key.

Series tags, on the other hand, are part of each series' composite primary key.

Since the total number of unique tag value identifiers is [limited](README.md#schema) to `16,777,215`, series tags are not recommended for high cardinality fields such as random values or continuously incrementing values (time, counters).

A text value, on the other hand, is stored as an annotation, without converting it to an identifier.

```ls
series d:2016-10-13T08:00:00Z e:sensor-1 m:temperature=20.3
series d:2016-10-13T08:15:00Z e:sensor-1 m:temperature=24.4 x:temperature="Provisional"
```

In this example, the temperature reading at `2016-10-13T08:15:00Z` is annotated as `Provisional`.

A text value can also be used to record observations for series that contain only text values, in which case their numeric values are set to `NaN`.

```ls
series d:2016-10-13T10:30:00Z e:sensor-1 x:status="Shutdown by adm-user, RFC-5434"
```

Unlike [message](message.md) commands, series text values are available for SQL querying using the `text` column.

```sql
SELECT entity, datetime, value, text
  FROM atsd_series
WHERE metric IN ('temperature', 'status') AND datetime >= '2016-10-13T08:00:00Z'
```

```ls
| entity   | datetime             | value | text                           |
|----------|----------------------|-------|--------------------------------|
| sensor-1 | 2016-10-13T08:00:00Z | 20.3  | null                           |
| sensor-1 | 2016-10-13T08:15:00Z | 24.4  | Provisional                    |
| sensor-1 | 2016-10-13T10:30:00Z | NaN   | Shutdown by adm-user, RFC-5434 |
```


## Text Append

The `append` flag applies to text values specified with the `x:` field.

If the append flag is set to `true`, ATSD checks the previous text value for the same timestamp. If the previous value is found, the new value is appended to the end using `;\n` (semi-colon followed by line feed) as a separator.

In order to prevent **duplicate** values, the database checks the existing value for duplicates by splitting the stored value into a string array and discarding the new value if it is equal to one of the elements in the array.

```ls
series d:2017-01-20T08:00:00Z e:sensor-1 x:status="Shutdown by adm-user, RFC-5434"
series d:2017-01-20T08:00:00Z e:sensor-1 x:status="Restart" a:true
```

The new value will be equal to:

```
Shutdown by adm-user, RFC-5434;
Restart
```

## Versioning

[Versioning](http://axibase.com/products/axibase-time-series-database/data-model/versioning/) enables tracking of time-series value changes for the purpose of establishing an audit trail and traceable data reconciliation.

Versioning is disabled by default. It can be enabled for particular metrics by checking the Versioning box on the Metric Editor page.

To insert versioning fields, use reserved tags:

* `$version_source`
* `$version_status`

```ls
series s:1425482080 e:e-vers m:m-vers=13 t:$version_status=OK t:$version_source=collector-1
```

If the metrics are versioned, the `$version_source` and `$version_status` tags will be converted to the corresponding versioning tags.
