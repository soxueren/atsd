# Secure Connectiion to Active Directory 

In order to setup a secure connection between an Axibase Time Series Database server and an Active Directory (AD) server for the purpose of LDAP user authentication, you need to import an LDAP Server Certificate from the target AD server into ATSD.

## Obtain SSL Certificate from LDAP Server

There are several ways of obtaining the SSL server certificate:

### Use LDAP Search or Windows `certutil`

Refer to [Sun Java System Identity Synchronization for Windows 6.0 Installation and Configuration Guide](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19656-01/821-0422/aarjd/index.html) for additional information.

### Export Certificate using a Web Brower such as Mozilla Firefox 

* Enter https, ldap hostname and SSL port in the browser address bar, for example `https://nur.axibase.com:636/`

* Press the [Advanced] button and then `Add exception` to retrieve the certificate.

## Import Server Certificate into ATSD Keystore File

* Add `servername.corp.company.com.crt` certificate: 


```css
keytool -importcert -keystore /opt/atsd/atsd/conf/server.keystore -storepass atsd_sec_pwd -keyalg "RSA" -trustcacerts -file servername.corp.company.com.crt
```

## Import Server Certificate into JXplorer Keystore

* Open `Security` -> `Trusted Servers and CAs`

* Click `Add Certificate`, select the crt file and add it to the keystore.

> Note that the cacerts keystore file has a default password of `changeit` (see [jxplorer docs](http://jxplorer.org/help/Setting_a_Keystore_Password.htm)).
