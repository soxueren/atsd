# Synonym Search

## Overview

Synonym search allows finding series with metadata fields containing values with a similar meaning in the original or other languages. 

For example, a user searching for series with 'currency' keyword might be interested in locating series with keywords 'money', 'cash' as well as 'geld' (German) and 'dinero' (Spanish).

The synonyms can be created for all [metadata fields](README.md/#overview).

## Configuration

The list of synonyms can be specified in the `conf/synonyms.conf` file accessible on the **Admin > Configuration Files** page.

## Syntax

The synonyms for a keyword are defined with the assign `=>` operator. The search results will match the same series when searched either by the keyword itself or one of its synonyms.

```css
keyword => synonym[, synonym]
```

Multiple synonyms can be specified on one line, separated by a comma.

Synonyms are disabled when the keyword is specified as field name. The following searches will yield different results:

```css
keyword:value
synonym:value
```

## Examples

* The word 'money' has one synonym.

```css
money => currency
location => place, site
```

Searching for 'money' would match series containing either keyword, 'money' or 'currency'.
The same results will be displayed if the 'currency' keyword is searched as well.

* The word 'location' has four synonyms.

```css
location => place, site, Ort, место
```

Searching for 'location' would match the below series since it has an entity tag 'location'.
Likewise, searching for 'ort' would match the same series since 'ort' is a synonym of 'location', which is one of the entity tags.

```sql
student_count         -- metric
nyu.edu               -- entity
location = NYC        -- entity tag
school = CAS          -- series tag
```

However, `location:NYC` and `place:NYC` searches would produce different results because synonyms are not supported in field names and therefore 'place' as a field name is not enabled as a synonym for the 'location' field name. As a result, `place:NYC` will not match the above series.

## Implementation

After the `conf/synonyms.conf` file is updated, the search index must be refreshed by an administrator on the **Admin > Diagnostics > Search Index** page.
